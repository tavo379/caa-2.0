                    We build high-performance commerce infrastructure and growth
                    systems for ambitious brands. No junior devs, no account
                    managers, no handoffs — just 11+ years of technical depth
                    applied directly to your business challenges.

                <h2>How Cacao & Avocado Started</h2>
                <p>
                    After 11+ years at BairesDev, Globant, and Zemoga — shipping
                    e-commerce projects for Disney, Walmart, and multinational
                    finance platforms — we saw the same problem repeatedly:
                    agencies overpromise, vendors undercommunicate, and clients
                    get stuck with technical debt from junior teams learning on
                    their dime.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cacao & Avocado was founded to solve this: senior-level
                    engineering only, direct communication with the people
                    writing code, and business-driven solutions over vanity
                    metrics. We're not a 50-person agency. We're a boutique
                    engineering firm that treats every project like it's our own
                    business.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our name? Cacao and avocado — two of Colombia's best
                    exports, just like our engineering. We combine deep
                    technical expertise (the richness of cacao) with practical,
                    growth-focused solutions (the versatility of avocado).

                        <h3>⚡ Performance First</h3>
                        <p>
                            Speed is a feature, not a nice-to-have. Every site
                            we ship targets 85+ Lighthouse scores and
                            sub-2-second load times. We optimize images,
                            lazy-load components, eliminate render-blocking
                            scripts, and continuously monitor Core Web Vitals.
                            Fast sites convert better.
                        </p>

                        <h3>💬 Transparent Communication</h3>
                        <p>
                            No black-box development. You get daily Slack
                            updates, weekly demos, and access to our project
                            board. We explain technical decisions in plain
                            English and involve you in architecture choices.
                            Typical response time: under 2 hours during business
                            hours.

                        <h3>🎯 Business-Driven Engineering</h3>
                        <p>
                            We don't build for engineering's sake — we build to
                            move business metrics. Every project starts with:
                            what's the goal? Then we architect the technical
                            solution. Code is the means, not the end.
                        </p>

                    <div class="principle-card">
                        <h3>✅ No Technical Debt</h3>
                        <p>
                            We write maintainable, well-documented code with
                            consistent patterns. No shortcuts, no "we'll fix it
                            later." Every project includes documentation,
                            testing, and handoff. We build for the long term.
                        </p>

                <h2>Our Work Philosophy</h2>
                <p>
                    We operate 100% remote-first, with core hours aligned to
                    EST/CST (9am-5pm your time). Based in Medellín, Colombia, we
                    offer the nearshore advantage: same-day communication,
                    overlapping work hours, and cultural alignment with US
                    clients — without the offshore delays or language barriers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our typical project: Agile 2-week sprints, weekly demos via
                    Zoom or Loom, Slack for daily communication, and shared
                    project boards. You'll always know what we're building, when
                    it ships, and why we made specific technical decisions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>We work best with:</strong> CTOs and technical founders
                    who value code quality, marketing leaders tired of slow agencies,
                    and e-commerce directors who need performance improvements with
                    measurable ROI.
